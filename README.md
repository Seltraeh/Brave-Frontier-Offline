# Brave-Frontier-Offline
At this point I've move to https://github.com/Seltraeh/decompfrontier.github.io

If you would like to help out with restoring Brave Frontier you can reach out to either Me or Arves100

My Discord is ``evan9935`` -or- contact me directly at ``edmartine418@gmail.com`` for help getting the development app up and running.

Huge shout-out to Arves100 for the progress he has made so far on the DecompFrontier Project.
